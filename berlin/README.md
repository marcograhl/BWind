Berlin's boroughs ("Bezirke") as KML and GeoJSON

The Statistical Office of Berlin and Brandenburg provides kml shapefiles of a number of administrative areas in Berlin, such as the localities within each borough. As I could not find the borders of the boroughs themselves, I merged all the the localities, thus providing only the 12 boroughs. 

The source of the shapefiles can be found at https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/produkte/opendata/geometrienOD.asp?Kat=6301
